[1913 Webster]

Allured his eye. --Milton. 

[1913 Webster] 

Syn: To attract; entice; tempt; decoy; seduce. 

Usage: To {Allure}, {Entice}, {Decoy}, {Seduce}. These words 

agree in the idea of acting upon the mind by some 

strong controlling influence, and differ according to 

the image under which is presented. They are all used 

in a bad sense, except allure, which has sometimes 

(though rarely) a good one. We are allured by the 

prospect or offer (usually deceptive) of some future 

good. We are commonly enticed into evil by appeals to 

our passions. We are decoyed into danger by false 

appearances or representations. We are seduced when 

drawn aside from the path of rectitude. What allures 

draws by gentle means; what entices leads us by 

promises and persuasions; what decoys betrays us, as 

it were, into a snare or net; what seduces deceives us 

by artful appeals to the passions.
